			What is CSS Animation
		</li>
		<img src="http://cliparts.co/cliparts/gce/AEE/gceAEE9ri.jpg" alt="question mark" class="question">
		<li class="slider">
			CSS animation is a model of CSS that defines how to animate the
			values of CSS properties over time, using keyframes, and the
			behavior of these keyframes can be controlled by specifying their
			duration, number of repetition, and how they repeat.
		</li>
		<li class="slider">
			<span class="colorTransform">A little history lesson.</span>
			Animation was first introduced by Webkit in 2007 and slowly over
			the years web browsers such as Firefox and Chrome began to support
			it.
		</li>
		<li class="slider">
			However, CSS3 animation became incresingly popular over 
			traditional script-driven animation due to its ease of use, 
			readibility and scalability.
		</li>
		<li class="slider">
			While transition allows users to trigger animations by means of
			Javascript, @keyframe allows repeated animations non-dependent on
			user.
		</li>
		<li class="slider">
			Just underneath this sentence you can observe a typical example
			of CSS animation in action...
