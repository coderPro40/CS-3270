<BODY>
my name is ThankGod Ofurum and I’m a senior majoring in Computer Science. <br>
I’m currently a system support technician student worker at the BSU IT department, and <br>
have been so for almost the past 2 years. During this time, I’ve developed a passion <br>
for problem-solving and computing, and this passion, coupled with my programming skills, <br>
have helped me perform 100% efficiently at the IT department. Currently, I’m seeking a <br>
position in the IT industry and my hobbies includes biking and playing soccer-I also enjoy <br>
reading novels when possible. <br>
